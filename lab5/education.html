                        The name is Experimental Junior High School. My favorite class is math class, just because I was 
                        good at math. In junior high school, we usually had lots of time after, so wo wolud like to play 
                        cards together. Since then, my friends and I are interested in playing cards and mahjong.

                    <p>
                        The name is Deron High school. There is no favorite class since the high school life is so boring, and we
                        had to study all the day from morning till night. Maybe physics class is some kind of interesting than the
                        others beacause the teacher would like to talk a lot of his funny experience.
